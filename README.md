## Introduction
ChatPet is an AI-based chatbot that aims to provide emotional support to users. The project focuses on creating a chatbot that can operate on normal devices with limited computing resources. This is a significant challenge, as current language models like GPT3 and LLaMA require extensive computing resources. The proposed project will address this challenge and make the chatbot accessible to a wider audience.
